# Unsplash App

Unsplash App is a React app created during a mentoring program with senior frontend developer - [Cristian Florea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-florea-396046123/)

The app allows users to view photos, search for photos, explore random photos, and save photos from the Unsplash stock photography website.

During the build process a workflow was created so that when a feature was completed, I created pull requests for Cristian to review and comment on any improvements or changes that could be made to my code. 

While creating Unsplash App I solidified and improved my knowledge of React, Redux, React router, and styled-components.

The app is available to view [here](https://instagram-clone-sandy.vercel.app/)
